I see you're working on a calculator app using Flutter. Nice job! It looks like you've got the basics down, including button functionality and handling arithmetic operations. Here are a couple of suggestions to enhance your code:

1. **Floating Point Precision:** Sometimes, calculations with floating-point numbers can result in a long string of decimals. You might want to round the result to a fixed number of decimal places.

2. **Error Handling:** It's a good idea to add some error handling for invalid inputs to prevent the app from crashing.

Here's a modified version of your `equalPressed` function to address these points:

```dart
void equalPressed() {
  String finaluserinput = userInput.replaceAll('x', '*');

  try {
    Parser p = Parser();
    Expression exp = p.parse(finaluserinput);
    ContextModel cm = ContextModel();
    double eval = exp.evaluate(EvaluationType.REAL, cm);

    // Rounding the result to 2 decimal places
    answer = eval.toStringAsFixed(2);
  } catch (e) {
    answer = 'Error';
  }
  
  setState(() {});
}
```

This will ensure your app provides a more user-friendly output and handles any errors gracefully. Keep up the great work with your Flutter and Java projects! If you need any more help or suggestions, feel free to ask.
